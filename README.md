# Database-Requests-Handler-using-Java-SQL

A Java program that can connect to my sqlite database called gameDatabase and answer my queries from there. When the program runs, it will first present a list of queries and will take the userâ€™s input in forms of queries numbered from 1 to 10 from lab 4 and return the answer for each one. 

In case if nothing or something else other than 1->10 is entered, the program will throw an error and tell the user to exit and try again.
